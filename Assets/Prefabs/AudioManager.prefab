    The AudioManager in a scene
    is for controlling universal sounds like music and menu noises.

    (Not for
    specific instance sounds like the player or giants. They have their own individual
    audio managers call ObjectAudioManager)



    Properties

    Sound Mixer is
    the mixer that controls the different audio levels



    Sound Groups is a list
    of individual sound collections with different adjustable volume and other properties.

    Each
    sound group contains another list of sounds for that group.This is where individual
    sound clips go.Each must be tied to a channel on the sound mixer.

    For example,
    you can have a sound group called Overworld Music which contains 3 sounds: the
    intro, the loop, and the outro.You can also specify which sound in the group
    you want to loop
